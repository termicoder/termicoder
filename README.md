### Future Ideas/ Todos 
1) Save encrypted passwords Confirm password(probably a common master password) on submit  
2) Make it advanced enough to handle multiple profiles for the same site . May be by implementing user interface.  
3) Should be a complete guide and reference  
4) Should be simple enough for beginners but compelling enough for advanced users  
5) It should be a learning resource for beginners as well as a great reference for advanced coders  
6) Make user learn new things (but in first version start with only c/c++/stl/linux basics)  
7) Make it availible as a bundle which incorporates various tools such as vim plugins but they should be minimum so work them out   
8) Make Users use good techniques that I have learned also ask competetive coders for suggestions.  
9) It should improve with the user progress. Refer to his profiles and code for the type of coder he is(which language he codes in). Ask him ques like which language he uses does he have knowledge of vim etc. If he is a begginer make him use best tools if advanced user suggest him the tools but try also to support his tools. also ask him to start from basics and then introduce complexity like code templates etc. 
10) Make it as good as a practical guide book for everyone it is a road with check points. One could start form check point confirming to his abilities.
11) Make people <3 this ;-)    
12) Somewhere in the future try integrating this with github repositories.... Private repository for current contest Public for old contests etc.  
previous index + 1 ) Be Sure enough to make a good website and improving markdowns:P
