# Current Ideas 
## View  
1) Current contests, trending problems, live problems etc. (Coders Calender)
2) Generating url corresponding to a problem code/name in an easy way for all the supported platform
3) Display the problem in best way possible, try not to leave terminal also be sure to somehow display the important images  
    options:  
    3.1) Use a terminal based browser such as w3m/elinks etc.   
    3.2) open the page in a browser (directly from terminal)   
    3.3) display as text on terminal  
    3.4) display a modified webpage on text based browser 
4) also open the links given in problem discription
5) Reminders about contests
  
general format : view judge problemcode  
context based shorter format if in a contest view  
  

## Code
1) most used predesigned but modifiable templates in the supported languages
2) Incorporate compile/build commands.. and autobuild on leaving editor (might need configure a default editor variable (ex. code abc.c executes vim abc.py directly loaded with the defaylt template etc.))  

general format : code problem_name.lxx  

## Debug
1) Check I/O corressponding to sample test cases
2) Test case generator
3) brute force generator for small values
4) calculation of time
5) Integration with existing debuggers (gdb etc.)

## Submit
1) easy submit directly from terminal
2) retrive status after submit
3) confirm password on submit  

general format : submit a.cpp

## Learn
1) assign/retrive categories of problems , open resources related to them
2) Link for editiorial/resources/google search the uncommon words in the problem statement etc.

# Future Ideas (The feasiblity of ideas hasn't been verified and most ideas are vague/in budding stage)
1) Save encrypted passwords confirm a common master password on submit  
2) Make it advanced enough to handle multiple profiles for the same site . May be by implementing user interface.  
3) Should be a complete guide and reference  
4) Should be simple enough for beginners but compelling enough for advanced users  
5) It should be a learning resource for beginners as well as a great reference for advanced coders  
6) Make user learn new things (but in first version start with only c/c++/stl/linux basics)  
7) Make it availible as a bundle which incorporates various tools such as vim plugins but they should be minimum so work them out   
8) Make Users use good techniques that I have learned also ask competetive coders for suggestions.  
9) It should improve with the user progress. Refer to his profiles and code for the type of coder he is(which language he codes in). Ask him ques like which language he uses does he have knowledge of vim etc. If he is a begginer make him use best tools if advanced user suggest him the tools but try also to support his tools. also ask him to start from basics and then introduce complexity like code templates etc. 
10) Make it as good as a practical guide book for everyone it is a road with check points. One could start form check point confirming to his abilities.
11) make a good website and improving markdowns
12) Somewhere in the future try integrating this with github repositories.... Private repository for current contest Public for old contests etc.
13) Try incorporating a settings webpage run on a local server
14) Incorporate machine learning/AI to test case generator, problem categoriser, problem template(input output variables, loops etc and to a greator extent)
15) Integrating with stopstalk- trending problems, friends etc.
16) Try integrating this with other applications that programmers use.
  
## Make people :heart: this :wink:
